For the uninitiated, "Advent of Code" is a yearly advent calendar that tells a story and has coding tasks that can be solved with any language.

This is my repository for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). Here you'll find my submissions for each year I've participated.

## Languages used for each year
- 2023: JavaScript
- 2024: Rust
