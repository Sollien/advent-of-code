For the uninitiated, [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a yearly advent calendar that tells a story and has coding tasks that can be solved with any language.

This is my repository for Advent of Code. Here you'll find my submissions for each year I've participated.

## Languages I used for each year
- 2023: JavaScript
- 2024: Rust
